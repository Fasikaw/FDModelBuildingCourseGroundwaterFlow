    "## Flow lines as opposed to stream lines\n",
    "Particle tracking is one of the functions most used in a groundwater model. Contrary to stream lines that require steady-state 2D flow without sources and sinks, particles may always be tracked to create flow lines. Clearly, particles starting at the same location may not follow the same path if released at different times in a transient model. In the random walk technique particles are even given a random displacement at each time step to simulate dispersion, which alters the path of individual particles in an unforeseen manner, thus simulating dispersion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Particle tracking in finite difference models is quite straightforward. The flows perpendicular to the cell faces are known and, therefore, the specific discharge at theses faces may be approximated by dividing by their surface area. Average. As the porosity in the cells at either side of a cell face may differ, so may the groundwater velocity perpendicular to the cell face, even though the specific discharge does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In finite difference modeling, the flow in `x`, `y` and `z`- direction, which is parallel to the axes of the model, is linearly interpolated between that at opposite cell faces. This implies that the flow in `x`-direction (and velocity for that matter) is only a function of `x`, the velocity in `y`-direction only a function of `y` and the one in `z`-direction only depends on `z`. This is consistent with the model assumptions and largely simplifies the analysis. However, for large cells it may not be accurate. So it may be necessary to use smaller cells where large variations in velocity occur in value and direction. On the other hand the elegance of this approach is that the divergence remains zero in a cell. This means no water is lost, so that the flow paths by themselves are consistent.\n",

    "## Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "It's easier to write equations in Lyx than it is to write them in markdown or pure LaTeX.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to use relative coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the elevation of cells in a 3D finite difference grid may vary from cell to cell in the same layer, it may jump when particles cross vertical cell faces. Exactly at such cell faces, the elevation is undetermined in such a grid. This makes it much more convenient to use relative coordinates, in which each cell of the grid is a cube of sides of length 1. To keep the travel time within each cell in each direction the same we divide the velocity in direction $x$ by $\\Delta x$ and likewise in the other directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we only have the flows at the cell faces, we have to assume that the velocity varies linearly between two opposite cell faces. For the x-direction we thus obtain for an arbitrary cell $v_{x}=\\frac{Q_{xL}}{\\epsilon R\\Delta y\\Delta z}+\\left(\\frac{Q_{xr}-Q_{xl}}{\\epsilon R\\Delta y\\Delta z}\\right)\\left(\\frac{x-x_{L}}{\\Delta x}\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\epsilon$ is the effective porosity of the considered cell and $R$ is the retardation due to sorption ($R=1$ in the absence of sorption).\n",

    "\n",
    "* Switch to normalized coordinates $u$, $v$, and $w$\n",
    "* Compute the velocities at all cell faces in all directions (6 values per cell)\n",
    "* To track particles compute in local coordinates when they hit the walls of their local cell, which is a uit cube in th normalize grid. The local coordinats are all between 0 and 1 in each cell. To get the normalized coordinates, add the indices of the cell, $u = iu + U$ where $iu$ is the cell index along the $u$ axis and $U$ the local coordinate.\n",
    "* Doing this and knowning by the sight of the velocity $vu$ wich cell face will be hit, we obtain three hitting times per particle. The smallest time is chosen, together with the corresponding cell face.\n",
    "* The particle is moved over this smallest time interval, updating its three ocal coordinates.\n",
    "* The index of the cell is updated for the direction into which the particle hits the cell facce.\n",
    "* The local coordinate of the particle in this direction is reset: if the particle left into the direction of\n",
    "inceasing grid index, it is reset to zero and 1 is added to its cell index is, if it left in opposite direction, it is set to 1.0 and its cell index is reduced by one.\n",
    "* The coordinates in the other two directions where the particle did not hit the cell face, are left unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time in the previous cell is subtracted from the remaining time, after which the procedure is repreated, as long as the remaining time is still larger than zero. After the remaining time has been used up by all particles that are still moving, the next time in the series for which we want particle coordinates has been reached. The particle coordinates are then saved after having them back-transformed to those of the original grid. This play is repeated until all particles have reached the final simulation time, or until no more flowing particles are presented in the model, because the last ones have been swallowed by sinks or stagnated near water divides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, the trackes can be displayed simultaneously or be simulated or animated. The stored partciles correspond to the times that were given to the model. The detail is therefore completely defined by the user."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We have implemented the particle tracking and used it both interactively as in batch mode. The method was verified by comparison with the stream lines drived from the stream function. Tracking particles allows computing travel times, both forward and backward tin time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow lines can be used where stream lines cannot, as flow lines don't require 2D divergence-free flow. Flow lines can also be used in transient situations. Flow lines with travel times are amongst the most used results of groundwater modeling, wherever pollution is involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "To even better track particles while including dispersion and diffusion, we could track massive amounts of particles. This also allows computation of arrival concentrations. This is the subject of the last chapter."
