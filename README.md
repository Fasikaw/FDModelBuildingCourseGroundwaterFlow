# TransientGroundwaterFlow
Transient Groundwater Flow Short Course (Module 3 at UNESCO-IHE, Delft, Netherlands)

I have given the short course Transient Groundwater Flow, analytical solutions for about 10 years. This year (2016)
I converted the text manual to a set of Jupyter notebooks, to not only have dead text, but also live code, that not only
I but also my students, may change and add to. It also facilitates issuing problems and come up with suggetions.

The idea to use Python is my conviction that students should nowadays learn two "things"  Python and QGIS. Not only can you computed
and do practically everything that is possible to code and visualize, but it also allows them to cooperate worldwide with
colleagues across any boundaries, physical or political. Python and QGIS are for engineers and scientists what is English for worldwide
communcation as was Latin in the Middel Ages. Pyhon and QGIS are free, so nobody can take it from you, no matter where you are
and who you are. It's up to you and only you to learn to use them.And by using these toolf for any computational and visualization
tasks, you're sure to become a master in it. They promise to be a liflong benefit. The posibilities provided to each individuals
by these tools are unprecedented.

Coming from 25 years of Matlab experience, I'm still learning myself. So this project is by no means ready nor am I by no means satisfied
with it. But one thing is certain, it's far easier and more fun to update both code and text than ever before and ever possible
when having to rely on a printed manual.
