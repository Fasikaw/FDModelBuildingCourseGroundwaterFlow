    "## Abstract ABSTRACT\n",
    "\n",
    "This syllabus explains the theory behind numerical groundwater modeling and how to make your own finite difference groundwater models in Python. The theory is equally well applicable to other computations and computer language environments like Octave, Scilab and Python. This syllabus aims at providing in-depth insight in numerical modeling of groundwater. It is also base for exercises in the master course CT5440, Geohydrology 2, of the TU-Delft. Although the structure is kept general, and, therefore applicable also to other times of models like finite element models and even surface water flow models, its focus is on finite difference models.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the course, the student will build his or her own finite difference model in Python. The student will see how flat, axially symmetric, 3D, steady-state and transient models are related. He will also learn how initial and boundary conditions are introduced. Special attention is given to effective treatment of fixed-head boundaries. The models are small Python functions, elegant yet powerful, i.e. capable of simulating simple and small as well as complex and and large groundwater flow problems.The examples serve to demonstrate some things what may be done as well to verify their accuracy including some pitfalls and how to avoid them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A real world modeling project is generally preceded by a stage where insight is gained into the answers to be provided and the structure and processes relevant in the system to be modeled. In a subsequent step, one or more conceptual models will be made to simulate groundwater behavior under a number of stresses of various types in terms of heads and flows that force the groundwater in the system. Such stresses are surface water elevations, recharge, evaporation, pumping and drainage. The questions to be answered in combination with the relevant complexity of the system also determine the detail of the model mesh to be used, both in space and time. Much time is generally spent on acquiring input and putting it into the form in which the model can use it. Nowadays, much information is often directly drawn from databases and already filled GIS systems, including remotely sensed data such a rain radar. However, one must remain very critical regarding the relevance and correctness of each data item with respect to the modeling problem at hand. In the end, the modeler is responsible for the outcomes, not the model or the computer. The results and predictions often stand at the basis of decisions that will affect livelihoods of people as well as habitats of plants and animals. Lack of time prohibits dealing with with such extended real-world problems in this course. Insight into the internal behavior of the model and the ability to verify its outcomes are more relevant to the engineer, and therefore, is the focus of this syllabus.\n",

    "Because MODFLOW, the open-source groundwater model of the United States Geological Survey, is worldwide the most used groundwater model, we'll stay close to its approaches and terminology so that the MODFLOW manual will look familiar to the student. MODFLOW is a fully-implicit 3D finite difference model written in FORTRAN. It can be downloaded together with its manual and source code from HTTP://water.USGS.gov/ogw/modflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python environment is far more expressive and, from that point of view more powerful than FORTRAN meaning we can set-up a powerful MODFLOW-like model in Python within a few tens of lines of code in way we can fully understand; MODFLOW requires thousands of lines of FORTRAN that are difficult to grasp unless you are a software engineer with expertise in FORTRAN and modeling at the same time. Python has the power to build a model line by line, interactively, while testing each part of the code immediately on screen, supported by its very powerful debugger, which points at the location where a problem occurred and allows full inspection of the circumstances that caused it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next to modeling, Python is also a powerful environment to visualize modeling results. Therefore, outside Python no additional packages are required. Some Python knowledge has, of course, to be acquired during the course. There exist very good Python books, documentation and tutorials on the web; vertually any question related to Python can be \"googled\" to find useful ansers.."

    "\n",
    "We will start with a general description of groundwater modeling and then derive an actual numerical model, which will finely be converted into a finite difference model by choosing the network and the way the so-called conductance between model cells are computed. The general overview that follows is valid for all kinds of numerical models. We will follow the general approach as long as possible because it provides the best insight with the least clutter."

    "## General overview numerical models\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical models divide the space to be modeled into an often large number subspaces, called elements in the Finite Element Method (FDM) or cells in the Finite Difference Method (FDM). The properties of each element or cell are specified and generally taken constant within. In the FEM, the heads will be computed at the nodes, whereas in the FDM they will be computed at the cell centers. In the FEM, flows will be computed between the nodes, whereas in the FDM they will be computed at the cell faces between adjacent elements. In the FDM the governing partial differential equation directly discretized on the grid, which takes the form of a water balance equation of each cell and, hence, for the model as a whole. The FEM requires that the partial differential equation integrated over each element is satisfied. Solving the model means adjusting all non-fixed nodal or cell heads such that the water balance over all cells and elements are satisfied simultaneously. The FEM and FDM generally lead to different grid shapes, see [fig:Different-model-meshes]. The elements associated with the FEM may be of arbitrary shape, while the shape in the FDM is generally more limited to regular hexagons or rectangular for instance. However, the newest version of MODFLOW, MODFLOW-USG which stands for “Un Structured Grid”, brings finite elements and finite differences much closer together by allowing arbitrarily shaped grids, but this is considered beyond the scope of this syllabus.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To stay close to MODFLOW, we will make a finite difference model with rectangular or block-shaped cells in which the properties of the subsurface are assumed constant and at the center of which the heads are computed. The flows are computed at the cell faces, i.e. between adjacent cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is straightforward to derive a full 3D finite difference model from the onset, we start with a 2D model for simplicity, where we divide the subsurface into Ny rows and Nx columns. The cell sizes thus defined may vary from column to column and from row to row. The thickness in the z-direction may vary if desired.. This configuration is shown in right-hand picture of figure [fig:Different-model-meshes]. This approach is easy to understand and easy to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The finial result of any of the possible derivations of the model equations, no matter if they are for a finite element model or a finite difference model, comes down to a system of equations, each of which is the water balance for a node or cell of that model. This system of equations represents all nodal water balances. Solving the model is fulfilling these water balances for all models simultaneously. This is achieved computing the unknown heads in the nodes/cells that make all nodal/cell water balances match simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FDM is derived by directly writing down equations for the water balance for the nodes; the FEM takes a more general approach by requiring the governing partial differential equation, which is the water balance on infinitesimal scale, to be optimally fulfilled within all of the elements. The the FEM is more complicated in deriving its equations and setting up the model, but the bonus is more flexibility in element shapes."

    "## Deriving and assembling a numerical model\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, any numerical groundwater model yields a set of water balances, one for each node. This is true for the FEM, the FDM as it is for any surface water model. In all such models the the space between nodes is replaced by links model types differ only in the way how this is done. In any case, the number of equations, as well as the number of unknowns, equals the number of non-fixed nodes, equals the number of water balances. A finite difference model of 300 rows, 300 columns and 10 layers thus has 0.9 million equations and the same order of unknowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure [fig:Model-node] shows some of the nodes (or cell centers) of an arbitrary finite element or finite difference model. For one node or cell, with index number i, the adjacent nodes are shown to which it is directly connected, that is, they share one element edge in the FEM or one cell face in the FDM (or one canal or river section in a surface water model). The only difference between these types of models is the way in which the connections are computed. So most of the discussion about modeling and model construction can be done without bothering about these specific details, which is the line followed in this syllabus, because it is most general. For the sake of simplicity whenever the word node is used it can be read as a node in the FEM or equally as a cell center in the FDM.\n",

The conductance comprises the properties of the area between the connected nodes and their distance. In case the conductance is not constant, as is the case in a surface water model or in a groundwater model with a water table in which the transmissivity is not known a priori, this flow must be computed iteratively. \n",
    "\n",
    "The physical meaning of the conductance is obvious: it is the flow of water $[L3/T]$ from node $i$ to node $j$ in case the head difference $\\phi_{i}-\\phi_{j}$ [L] equals 1 [L]. The actual dimension depends on the system used, i.g meters and days or feet and hours.\n",

Hence inflow from the outside world into the model is taken positive. The left -hand side thus represents the flow from node i through the model towards its connected neighbors. We will deal with transient models later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nodal inflow $Q_{i}$, is the sum of all inflows of water from the outside world into node $i$ minus the extractions of water from node $i$ to the the outside world. Therefore, $Q_{i}$ combines recharge, injections, extractions, leakage, drainage and so on, summed over and integrated over the space attributed to the node (FEM) or cell (FDM). \n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that $i$ and $j$ run over all the nodes of the model. This equations expresses that node $i$ may be connected to any or all other nodes of the model no matter how far apart. Of course, in an ordinary model each node is only connected to its direct neighbors. Therefore, most of the conductances $C_{ij}$ are zero. In case a node has n connected neighbors, only $n+1$ of these conductances are non-zero for each node. Therefore, of a model with $N$ nodes has $N\\times N$ possible connections of which $N$ with node $i$. These connections, and hence, conductances, potentially fill a matrix of $N$ rows and $N$ columns. Notice that a finite difference model with a grid consisting of $N_{x}$ rows by $N_{y}$ columns and $N_{z}$ layers, ha $N=N_{x}\\times N_{y}\\times N_{z}$ cells, and, therefore, this $N\\times N$ array can easily exceed the memory capacity of any available computer. For instance, a model having “only” 300 rows, 300 columns and 10 layers has $N=0.9$ million cells and hence the $N\\times N$ array of possible conductances has $N^{2}=0.81\\times10^{12}$ entries. With, with 4 bytes per value to be stored this would require a computer memory of $3\\times10^{12}$ bytes or about 3 terabyte. This is huge for any internal computer memory. However, if we only store the non-zero values, then the maximum number of conductance to be stored it tremendously reduced. In a 3D finite difference model the maximum number of connected neighbors of any cell is 7. This implies that the number of non-zero values can be no more than $7\\times N$ , i.e. $7\\times4\\times0.81\\times10^{6}\\approx\\ 30$ Mb in the example model. This memory storage peanuts on even a modern PC with for instance 8 GB internal memory. In fact the array of conductances is extremely sparse. In this case the fraction of non-zero values is at most $7\\times N/N^{2}=7/N\\approx10^{-5}$ or 0.001%.. We will therefore make use of this sparsety when storing the system matrix and solving the model, because, if we do not do this, our computer could not even handle a small size model!\n",

Heads that are fixed directly at a node of the model, i.e. fixed heads, become a limiting case in which the conductance approaches $\\infty$ or the resistance approaches zero.
