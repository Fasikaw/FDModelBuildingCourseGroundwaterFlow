    Parameters
    ----------
    `Out` : namedtuple holding arrays `Qx`, `Qy`, `Qz` as defined in `fdm3`
        `Qx` : ndarray, shape: (Ny, Nx-1, Nz), [L3/T]

    `gr` : `grid_object` generated by Grid
    `iz` : int [-]
            iz is the number of the layer for which the data are requested,
            and all output arrays will be 2D for that layer.
            if iz==None, then all outputs will be full 3D arrays and cover all layers
            simultaneously
